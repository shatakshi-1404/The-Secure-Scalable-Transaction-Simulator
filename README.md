# The-Secure-Scalable-Transaction-Simulator
Project Idea 1: The Secure & Scalable Transaction Simulator
This project directly mirrors the core of Visa's business: processing financial transactions securely and reliably.

Why it gets selected:

Core Tech Alignment: Hits the #1 requirement: C++ and Object-Oriented Design.

Domain Relevance: Demonstrates understanding of transaction processing, concurrency, and data integrityâ€”all critical for VisaNet.

Sophistication Signal: Working with multi-threading and network sockets shows you can handle complex, performance-critical systems.

How to Build It:

Core Components (OOD):

Transaction Class: Holds transaction ID, amount, timestamp, status (APPROVED/DECLINED), etc.

Account Class: Manages account balance. Uses mutexes for thread safety.

TransactionProcessor Class: The heart of the system. Contains a thread pool to process transactions concurrently.

AuditLogger Class: A thread-safe logger that writes every transaction and its outcome to a file (simulating a secure audit trail).

Key Features to Implement:

Concurrent Processing: Use the C++ Standard Thread Library (<thread>, <mutex>) to create a thread pool. The processor pulls transactions from a queue and processes them simultaneously on multiple threads.

Basic "Fraud" Rule: Implement a simple rule (e.g., "decline if transaction amount > account balance" or "decline if more than 5 transactions in a minute from the same account") to show logical reasoning.

Network Interface (Bonus): Use a simple socket library (like Boost.Asio or plain Berkeley sockets) to allow clients to send transaction requests over the network. This is a huge plus.

Metrics: Calculate and report metrics like transactions per second (TPS), approval rate, and average processing time.

Tech Stack: C++17/20, Standard Thread Library, STL (Queues, Vectors), (Optional) Boost.Asio.

What to highlight on your resume:

"Engineered a high-performance, multi-threaded transaction processing system in C++ capable of handling X transactions per second."

"Applied Object-Oriented Design principles and thread synchronization primitives (mutexes) to ensure data consistency and prevent race conditions."

"Implemented a thread-safe audit logging system to guarantee data integrity and a full transaction trail." can you give complete code for this
